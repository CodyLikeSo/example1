Arch - Words cannot describe how much I fell in love with this system when a friend recommended it to me for the first time. I started using Linux systems with the Manjaro distribution. At that moment I tried the console for the first time and realized that this is what I wanted. I've always lacked the quick startup and tracking of processes like launching applications by typing a single command or working with Git repositories without touching the code editor. Also, I can't help but notice the fast performance of the system even on an hdd disk, and the ability to customize it to fit my needs.

React - Initially I wasn't very interested in frontend development, but I realized that I needed to master it in order to bring my projects to a tangible result. I started exploring different frameworks, libraries and tools, and eventually chose React. Along with learning React, I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Instead of classic CSS, I used Tailwind for my projects. One of my first projects was the creation of this website, even though it looked very different before. Now I can confidently say that I know how to work with React and handle frontend development tasks.

Python - Python is the first programming language for me, from which I thoroughly started my career in IT. Thanks to it I wrote simple scripts, telegram bots, DS ML algorithms and interacted with databases. I like the easy entry threshold and the learning potential. Everyone says the language is easy - but it's just a language. Problems and difficulties start when a programmer realizes that the programming language is just a tool in his hands and the really hard things come later.

Rust - I have very little experience with rust, but I truly admire this language. I love its rigor and adaptability. I am very happy to devote some of my time to learning it. In particular, an actual application for me right now is the Bevy framework. My plans include creating my own games, so I started learning rust.
