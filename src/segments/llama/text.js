- MoneyFactory: Python dev | React dev

01.08.21 - 01.10.22
MoneyFactory is a fast-growing fintech startup that literally started with me.When I started looking for my first job I came across their job posting for a python developer. 
However, I did more than just python development.

In the beginning I was given small tasks like generating images for our products, working on special text documents with a focus on analysis and reserch, and working with PostgreSQL databases. Then I was finally given tasks related to python - development of aggregators, parsers and scrapers, telegram bot, building and maintaining API services. Later, having learned that I also worked with react I was slowly introduced into Web development. I participated in the creation of their main site. This work gave me a lot of experience as a backend and frontend programmer.

Stack as Developer
Python: work with Fastapi, OpenAI API, Pytest, Telegram-API.
Node JS: work with React, Tailwind CSS, HTML
PostgreSQL: create and control
Docker-compose: usage for build
- IVCapital: Project Manager | DS&ML
01.10.2022 - 01.08.23

Translated with DeepL.com (free version)
IVCapital is a small fintech startup where I came at the invitation of a classmate. In our small team, I had to take on several roles: I worked as a data analyst and project manager.

As a DS-analyst, I worked on databases, collecting statistics on the efficiency of our products, including HFT-bots for stock trading. 
I also performed small tasks such as creating Telegram bots and integrating them with channels.As a project manager, I maintained documentation, distributed and structured tasks, and communicated with customers. 
The main thing I learned from working at IVCapital is the ability to adapt to new conditions and technologies, both from the point of view of a programmer and a project manager.

- JetSite.ru: Project Manager
01.08.21 - 01.10.22
JetSite is a B2B team building web applications for every taste and color. 
In this company, I worked as a full-fledged project manager and managed a team of 4-8 people depending on the project. 
We had about six projects: two frontend-focused websites, three backend-focused websites using OpenAI APIs, and one mobile app that I was also involved in developing.

My job was to maintain technical and project documentation, interact with the team, and most importantly, communicate with customers. In this aspect, I pumped up my skills considerably as I had to negotiate with the customers' technical and business experts for all six projects. It was quite stressful, especially since I was put in a situation where the customers were already unhappy as my boss was not handling the workload. This job taught me the true art of project management in a high-pressure and stressful environment.

- Svetoch Press: Project Manager
01.08.21 - 01.10.22
Svetoch Press is a popular book publisher from St. Petersburg. 
Unlike previous jobs, business processes were built here. 
If my previous job had taught me to operate under stress and constant conflicts, things were completely different here. I worked in a measured manner, dealing with project documentation and single-handedly managing the creation of the main product-service. I set deadlines and interacted with customers.

In this job, I felt trusted and respected. I coordinated all departments involved in the creation of the service - backend, frontend and design. In addition, I also acted as a developer, finalizing the APIs needed for our service and deploying them myself using Docker. This job showed me what it's like to be part of a calm team with professionalism, without conflict or misunderstandings.
